Saga Ragnarok Online 2 Emulator
-------------------------------

SagaRO2 is an open source MMORPG emulator project for the sequel to Gavity's popular Ragnarok Online game.

About the project
-----------------
The project was conceived in around 2005 and by 2006, the small team of a few European developers had successfully reverse engineered Gravity's MMORPG server software before it was even out of beta.
The community grew and a number of hosts sprung up to run Saga's emulator. Development continued in a race to keep up with Gravity's official updates. 

Packets were sniffed.
Code was written.
Late nights were had.

Unfortunately, while the game wa hugely anticipated, Gravity's sequel to their immensely popular RagnarokOnline game received poor reviews from players and Gravity was forced to close the beta and redesign the entire game from scratch.

Status
-----
The code (and the original game) is no longer under development. Thanks to everyone who contributed during the time it was running. 

Here are some screenshots from one of servers running the Saga software in its prime:
